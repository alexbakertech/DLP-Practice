## Overview

## Configuration

This VM will run Windows 10 because it is easier to virtualize than Windows 11 in its current state. I have assigned the following specifications to this VM:

| CPU    | RAM   | Storage | VLAN | IPv4 |
| ------ | ----- | ------- | ---- | ---- |
| 4 vCPU | 4 GiB | 50 GB   | 830  |      |
